![Headless Drupal](http://davidhwang.github.io/horseman/logo.min.svg)

## A Manifesto

- We want Drupal to be the _preferred_ back-end content management system for designers and front-end developers.

- We believe that Drupal's main strengths lie in the power and flexibility of its back-end; its primary value to users is its ability to architect and display complex content models.

- We believe that client-side front-end frameworks are the future of the web.

- It is critically important for Drupal to be services oriented first, not HTML oriented first, or risk becoming irrelevant.
